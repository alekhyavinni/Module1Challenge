# description

AS per the client -- marketing agency
I created a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that  the  website is optimized for search engines

I created the source code  that meets accessibility standards
I used semantic HTML elements
I structured the HTML elements
I created a logical structure independent of styling and positioning to the elements
The icon ,image elements & heading attributes meets accessibility standards
I added alt attributes to the Img Tags
They follow a  sequential order
I gave a concise & descriptive title in the title element.
I created a nav tag for better understanding and accessibility
I created a fixed header tag
